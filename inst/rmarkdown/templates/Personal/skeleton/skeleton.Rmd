# Get the data
***
Always start by loading *libraries*. The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) is probably the package I use the most. Quite difficult to imagine analysing data without it. It is a good practice to load all the packages in the same time. It allows to know exactly what is needed to reproduce your analysis.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rmarkdown)    # You need this library to run this template.
library(ProjectTemplates)      # Install with devtools: install_github("holtzy/epuRate", force=TRUE)
```
