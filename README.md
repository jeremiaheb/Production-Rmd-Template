Acknowledgment

This package was forked from the wonderful [Epurate template package](https://holtzy.github.io/epuRate/). 

EpuRate is [a custom R Markdown template](https://holtzy.github.io/epuRate/) for your reports. It allows to get a uncluttered output with your contact details in the footer. It is very easy to use.
